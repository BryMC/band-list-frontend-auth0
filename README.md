# Adding Auth0 to the Band List app

We're going to revisit your band list app from last week. You are going to add Auth0 to your front end so that your app will only display your band list when a user is logged in.

## Steps
#### Step 1: Fork and clone the homework rep 
- Just like always

#### Step 2: Check the main.js file to ensure you are using the correct url for your AJAX calls
- The starter code uses `http://localhost:3000/bands`. Be sure your API uses the same url. If not, edit main.js to match your url

#### Step 3: From the command line cd into your band-list-api directory and type 'nodemon' to start your server

#### Step 4: Open another command line tab and cd into band-list-frontend-auth0. Run either `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4000` or `serve . -p 4000`
